"Building Tomorrow, Today"

YouthHelpYouth is a youth-led organization based in Jamaica. We believe that young people have the power to lead, serve, and rebuild our communities right now.

Our current mission is the Hurricane Melissa Relief Project. We are focused on providing families in Westmoreland, St. James, and Hanover with 7-Day Relief Bags filled with essential food, water, and hygiene supplies.

Our Core Values:

Youth Leadership: Proven by action, not just age.

Transparency: Tracking every donation to ensure it reaches those in need.

Resilience: Helping Jamaica get up stronger after the storm.
